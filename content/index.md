# Welcome to the Club!

This is the place for the coolest, sickest RatRod NFT collection on the Web! Each collectibile NFT _is completely unique_, and new cars will be released each week so be sure to check back often for new models and wicked new features!

## Mint Your Own RatRod!

**Each RatRod is completely unique!** Some features, colors and backgrounds are rare, and some more common. For each edition, I will be dropping a limited-number edition to the mix, including different car models and crazy components! The maximum mint for any car model will be capped at 5,000 to help maintain their value and encourage trading.

## NEW! Rattie RatRacers PFPs!

<span markdown="1" class="ratblock">**Every RatRod needs a RatRacer!** RatRacer Rodney is a PFP edition which will be used in the game (under development) along with the RatRodz cars. Each Rattie has a ton of attitude, and some nice rarity features. Currently edition 2 of RatRodz Race Club contains 750 Ratties.</span>
