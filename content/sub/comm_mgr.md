## Our Community Manager, ElvisGAN

Hello RatRodz Club! Today I am joining the team as a Community Manager. You'll find me in the Discord and Telegram. I have a background in marketing, with heavy emphasis on the social media side.

My introduction to the RatRodz project was in November 2021 by the lead developer, @JCWretlind. Jon and I have worked closely together on several projects in the past, and I am always impressed with his work. He is gifted in being able to clearly communicate a vision, and execute it. Jon has the drive to design "human experiences" rather than "user experiences", and he is usually found at the intersection of tech and design; A perfect fit for the emerging NFT landscape.

I hopped on this opportunity once it was presented to me. Truth be told, I started minting like mad after I signed on to the project. (At .03 SOL, who wouldn't?) ðŸ˜‚

So why am I investing my time and resources here? Because I believe NFTs are the future, and that anyone investing in quality NFTs now will realize a large upside within the next few years. Being in on the ground floor of a project like this is rare, and I appreciate rarity. As the NFT landscape progresses, I believe that folks will want to have, trade, and show off their super slick RatRodz.

So then, I am joining the RatRodz team as Community Manager and I'm open to ideas about how we can improve as we move forward. Iâ€™ll also likely contribute on the various other exciting projects that we have on the roadmap. I am blessed to be here, and will do my best to light up this community. Thanks for reading, and a big thanks to Jon for the opportunity!
